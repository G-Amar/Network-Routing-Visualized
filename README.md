# Network-Routing-Visualized

This is a Github project that visualizes various routing algorithms used in computer networks. Specifically, the project focuses on Decentralized Distance-Vector and Centralized Djikstras algorithms. It was created to help teach the concepts of routing in computer networks.

## Technologies

The project is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes the cytoscape.js graphing library to represent nodes and edges as a graph. Vite was used as a package manager.

## Functionality

The project offers full step functionality to show each individual update to the internal tables for each node. This enhances the learning experience and makes it easier to understand what the algorithms are doing at each step.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the need to teach routing algorithms in computer networks in a more visual way. It was made possible thanks to the cytoscape.js graphing library and the many open-source contributors who made it possible.
